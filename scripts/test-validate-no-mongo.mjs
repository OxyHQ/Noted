/**
 * Mutation-tests `validate-no-mongo.mjs`.
 *
 * A guard that has only ever been seen to pass is indistinguishable from one
 * that cannot fail — and this one is especially easy to break silently, because
 * every part of it is a regex or a file listing and both fail QUIET. A broken
 * `git ls-files` reports a clean tree. A regex with a typo reports a clean tree.
 * Each case below breaks exactly one thing and requires the guard to fail, and
 * to fail with the words that identify the right rule.
 *
 * The cases that must PASS matter as much: this repository's comments discuss
 * Mongo constantly, on purpose, and both loggers carry a Mongo-URI redaction
 * pattern that is wanted. A version of this guard that fired on either would be
 * disabled by whoever hit it first.
 *
 * Fixtures are real trees with a real `git init`, so the guard's actual file
 * listing runs rather than a stand-in for it.
