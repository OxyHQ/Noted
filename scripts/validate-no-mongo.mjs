/**
 * Noted is PostgreSQL-only. This refuses to let MongoDB back in by accident.
 *
 * ## What it guards, and why a guard rather than a memory
 *
 * Mongoose was removed wholesale after the Postgres cutover (PR #136): the models,
 * every Mongoose model, the driver dependencies, the connection config. What
 * makes that removal fragile is not the code — it is that Mongo comes back in
 * SMALL pieces, each individually reasonable and none of them alarming in a
 * diff. A `mongodb` dependency arrives as a transitive of something else and
 * gets hoisted into a manifest to pin it. A `MONGODB_URI` reappears in a
 * workflow because a one-shot needed it. Someone reaches for
 * `mongodb-memory-server` because it is the fixture library they know.
 *
 * None of those fail a build. The first one that DOES fail something is the
 * fourth or fifth, by which point the honest description of the repository is
 * "two databases", and nobody decided that.
 *
 * So this is a decision gate, not a lint: reintroducing Mongo is allowed, it
 * just has to be a decision somebody makes on purpose and writes down, either by
 * deleting this file or by adding a reasoned `KNOWN_EXCEPTIONS` entry.
 *
 * ## The four surfaces
 *
 *   1. **Manifests** — a banned package named in any dependency field, in the
 *      root `overrides`, or in `workspaces.catalog`.
 *   2. **The lockfile** — a recorded resolution for a Mongo driver, which is
 *      what actually lands the code in `node_modules` whatever the manifests
 *      say. Matched on the resolution's own package NAME, never as a substring,
 *      so `mongodb-memory-server` and `mongodb` stay distinguishable and an
 *      unrelated package whose name contains one of them cannot trip it.
 *   3. **Source imports** — real import syntax only, anchored on a
 *      quote-delimited specifier. A docblock writing `import mongoose` in
 *      backticks is prose about history and must not fire; this repository's
 *      comments are FULL of such prose, deliberately, and a gate that fired on
 *      it would be turned off within a day.
 *   4. **Config and env** — `MONGODB_URI` or a live `mongodb://` /
 *      `mongodb+srv://` connection string in an env template, a compose file, a
 *      workflow, a `.github` shell script, or any source file.
 *
 * Markdown is exempt everywhere. Docs are where the history of a migration is
 * supposed to live, and a guard that forbade describing Mongo in prose would be
 * asking the repository to forget why it moved. That exemption is a property of
 * the four scan sets rather than a filter: none of the patterns below can match
 * a `.md` path. An explicit markdown exclusion WAS written here and removed —
 * mutation-testing showed it could be deleted with every self-test still green,
 * because no input exists that the two versions answer differently. Widening
 * `SOURCE_FILE` is what would change that, and a self-test case stands over it.
 *
 * ## Two near-misses that are wanted, and must keep passing
 *
 * Both loggers redact Mongo URIs out of log lines — `packages/mcp/lib/logger.ts`
 * and `packages/backend/src/utils/logger.ts` each carry a pattern whose source
 * text reads `mongodb(?:\+srv)?):\/\/`. That is a REDACTION and it stays: logs
 * can still carry a legacy URI from somewhere upstream. The connection-string
 * check looks for the literal `mongodb://`, which that escaped regex source does
 * not contain, so neither file matches — verified rather than assumed, and
 * pinned by a self-test case.
 *
 * The same files carry `mongouri` and `mongoUri` as redaction KEY names, and
 * those pass for a duller reason than they look: the env-variable check wants
 * the character sequence `mongodb_uri`, and a key spelled `mongouri` simply is
 * not it. A case-sensitive check was written here first, justified by those
 * keys; the justification was wrong, since no casing of `MONGODB_URI` matches
 * them either. It reads case-INSENSITIVELY now, which is strictly the broader
 * check and costs nothing — measured, no case variant exists in the tree.
 *
 * Usage:  bun scripts/validate-no-mongo.mjs
