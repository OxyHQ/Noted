/**
 * drizzle-kit configuration.
 *
 * - `bun run db:generate` diffs `schema` against `out/` and writes a new SQL
 *   migration. It never opens a database for that, and it only ever runs on a
 *   developer's machine.
 * - Migrations are APPLIED by `bun run db:migrate` (`src/db/migrate.ts`), which
 *   uses drizzle-orm's own migrator over the files in `out/` — never
 *   `drizzle-kit migrate`.
 *
 * `casing` decides what the DDL CREATES; the same constant passed to
 * `createDatabase()` in `src/db/postgres.ts` decides what queries REFERENCE.
 * Both read `DATABASE_CASING` from `@oxyhq/db`, so there is one setting rather
 * than two copies to keep in lockstep — disagreement means queries reference
 * columns the migrations never created.
 *
 * ## Every generated migration needs a deploy-phase marker
 *
 * drizzle-kit cannot add it, so after each `db:generate` open the new
 * `drizzle/<tag>.sql` and add exactly one line:
 *
 *     -- oxy:deploy-phase=pre      additive; safe while the previous image serves
 *     -- oxy:deploy-phase=post     drops/renames/narrows; only once the new image is live
 *
 * `db:migrate` refuses to apply an unmarked migration, before any DDL runs.
